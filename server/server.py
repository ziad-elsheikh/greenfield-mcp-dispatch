GREENFIELD AGRICULTURE — RESTRICTED CHEMICAL APPLICATION POLICY (v1.2)

1. Buffer zones
   - Minimum 15 meters from any waterway, canal, or irrigation channel
     for 'restricted' hazard-class chemicals.
   - Minimum 8 meters from any waterway for 'controlled' hazard-class
     chemicals.
   - No buffer zone required for 'low' hazard-class products.

2. Wind conditions
   - No spray application of 'restricted' or 'controlled' chemicals
     when sustained wind exceeds 15 km/h.

3. Sign-off requirement
   - Any dispatch job carrying a chemical flagged requires_signoff = 1
     in the Chemicals table must receive explicit human sign-off before
     the equipment is dispatched.

4. Record-keeping
   - Every restricted or controlled application must be logged with
     technician ID, field ID, and timestamp in Dispatch_Jobs.

5. Emergency response
   - If a restricted-chemical job triggers an equipment fault or leak,
     the technician must call emergency_stop immediately and file an
     Incident_Notes entry before the equipment can be redispatched.
